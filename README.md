# Dunce-Cap
Party game to keep your phone on your head!

# How to play 
The goal of Dunce Cap is to see how long you can keep your phone balanced on your head.
It can be a fun party game, a game you compete against friends, or a game that boosts your 
productivity when your phone isn't in sight (because it's on your head, silly). 

Push the big play button on the home page to start. You will have 5 seconds to place your 
phone on your head with the screen facing up and the back on your head. After the 5 seconds 
is up, the app will record your phone's initial angle on your head. 

If your phone moves more than 30 degrees from the initial angle, you lose.\n\nMake sure to
play with sound on, so you know when you lose...or about to lose!
