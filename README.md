Party game to keep your phone on your head!

# How to play 
The goal of Duncer is to see how long you can keep your phone balanced. It can be a fun party game, a game you compete against friends, or a game that boosts your productivity (if you balance your phone on a table and pick it up, you lose). 

Push the big play button on the home page to start. You will have 5 seconds to balance your phone with the screen facing up and the back directly touching the object. After the 5 seconds is up, the app will record your phone's initial angle. If your phone moves more than 30 degrees from the initial angle, you lose.

Make sure to play with sound on, so you know when you lose...or about to lose!
